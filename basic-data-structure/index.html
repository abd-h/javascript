    <h1>Basic Data Structure</h1>
   <p>
        Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data Structures - arrays and objects.
        
        In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learned more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to
        use in different situations. You'll learned how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to accessed
        and manipulate data.
