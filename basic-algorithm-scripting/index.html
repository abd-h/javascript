    <h1>Basic Algorithm Scripting</h1>
    <p>
        An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
        To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and 
        think carefully about how to solve each parts with code. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing  algorithm 
        that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.
