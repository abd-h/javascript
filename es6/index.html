    <h1>ES6</h1>
    <p>
        ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all majaor browsers follow this specification, the ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this poiny was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        ES6, resleased in 2015, added many powerful features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, includeing arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.
